<h1>Avigdor Arikha</h1>

<p>Avigdor Arikha (1929-2010), Israeli printmaker, art historian, essayist, painter, and draftsman, was, from 1956 until SB’s death in 1989, one of the author’s closest and most trusted friends. Arikha was born near Czernowitz in the Bukovina. Along with the other Jewish families of the region, he, his sister, and his parents were deported in 1941 towards the Western Ukraine, where the family ended up, after the death of Arikha’s father, in a labor camp. Set to heavy manual work in an iron foundry, Arikha owed his survival to a series of drawings he made of atrocious conditions in the ghetto, that were transmitted to the International Red Cross, representatives of which succeeded in removing him and his sister from the ghetto and conveying them to Palestine, where they arrived in 1944.</p>
 <p>Arikha studied at the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem in 1946, then fought and was seriously wounded in 1948 in the Israeli War of Independence. After recuperating, in 1949, he visited Paris for the first time to study at the École des Beaux Arts. After a further stay in Jerusalem, from 1954 he was again resident in Paris, meeting SB - without at first realizing who he was - in June 1956 after a performance of <em>En attendant Godot</em>. He told the editors that his decision to make Paris his permanent home was directly due to the admiration he felt for SB. Through the 1950s and into 1965, Arikha’s painting was abstract; after which, following a crisis of faith in such work, he spent nearly eight years working only in black and white (drawings, etchings, lithographs), and exclusively from life. Then and subsequently he made many drawings of SB as well as a series of five sugar-lift aquatints conceived to accompany SB’s text Au loin un oiseau. From 1973, color re-entered Arikha’s work, which continued to be executed rapidly and from life, and which frequently presented - as well as themselves representing - intense acts of observation, often through oil on canvas: still lifes, landscapes, self-portraits. For his portraits, a common subject was his wife, the American poet Anne Atik, a close friend of SB in her own right and the author of a full account of the couple’s friendship with him, <em>How it Was: A Memoir of Samuel Beckett</em>.</p>
<p>Arikha’s work, both in its abstract and its figurative phases, received warm-hearted support from SB, who in 1982 wrote a letter supporting the painter’s nomination for a MacArthur Foundation award. The two men would meet regularly, either at Arikha’s home near Port Royal in Paris or in their preferred restaurants and bars. During his periods of residency in New York and Jerusalem, Arikha continued to correspond regularly with SB, the link between the two men being strengthened by, among other shared interests such as music, their fondness for erudition and languages: Arikha described himself (again to the editors) as “fluent in five languages, not including the three I have forgotten.” Arikha was an eminent art historian whose <em>oeuvre</em> includes works on Poussin and Ingres, the wide-ranging study <em>Peinture et regard</em>, and numerous articles on artists from Caravaggio to Watteau to Cézanne to Giorgio Morandi; he lectured at universities worldwide. His work features in many private and public collections and, since 1972, has been represented by the Marlborough Gallery. Arikha was one of the small handful of SB’s friends who attended his funeral in December 1989.</p></div>
