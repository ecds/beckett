<h2>Barbara Bray</h2>
<p>Barbara Bray (1924-2010), producer, translator, critic, found her way into radio after graduating from Cambridge University. She worked mostly for the BBC drama department, where for years she was a key figure. Life was not always kind to her. She was widowed early, leaving her with sole care of her two daughters, Francesca (Checchina) and Julia. She met SB over his first venture in radio, <em>All That Fall</em>, which she produced for the BBC Third Programme in February 1958. Few people can have come so close to SB. Lively, inventive, and with a strong literary sensibility, she was the ideal person to help him through his characteristic unconfidence about the new medium; not least because she saw at once that it was perhaps, of all the media, the one best suited to his gifts. SB was soon to feel totally at home with the BBC Sound Drama team (the others at that time were Donald McWhinnie and John Morris), but his connection with Bray, while unfailingly and productively professional, went well beyond that. There should be no surprise there: this unambiguously warm and attractive woman was passionately concerned with words. Her literary and linguistic gifts and her many interests equipped her to stand the test of his wariness as few people could. He came to trust her as well as loving her, and the measure of this trust was that he could and did, over the years, talk and write to her without reservations about his work, current or projected - and could receive what she had to say. It was a powerful combination. So close indeed were they in their qualities and concerns that, in anyone less unpretentious than Bray, there might have been the risk of rivalrous feelings, conscious or unconscious - they were, after all, both translators. In fact, she never saw herself as a writer, and was aware from the beginning that for SB, translating was simply one of the directions his writing would take, and by no means the most important.</p>

<p>In 1960, she left her position in the BBC following a change of regime, and in 1961 moved with her daughters to Paris. By now her own career was taking shape: translations, from writers as various as Anouilh, Duras, Genet, Kristeva and Robbe-Grillet; editorial work, productions for radio; broadcasting in her own right (she was an occasional contributor to the admirable and long-running Sunday radio series <em>The Critics</em>). Her companionship with SB was intensely lived and durable: he never lost his affection and respect for her. They had much to give each other, and gave it, even though, by SB's choice, they never lived together.</p>
