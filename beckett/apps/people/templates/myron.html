<h1>Herbert Myron</h1>
  
<p>Herbert Myron (1906-1990) was an academic who took his PhD at Harvard in 1939, and who taught at the University of Boston from 1934 to 1972. SB was used to dealing with academics - and more and more of them were to approach him as his fame and reputation grew - but was seldom wholly at ease with them, mainly because of their tendency to seek explanations, or test theories. Myron was one of the few with whom there were no such difficulties, although academically he was someone of note who had written widely on the literature of post-War France. Their correspondence spans the years 1966-1984, and shows what being at ease meant for SB: not having to wonder if he could or should say this or that, but following the promptings as they came - short cuts, jokes, confessions; all the pleasures of dealing with someone he liked. “How I envy your vitality. A physical would finish me so perhaps time I had one . . . Send along some of that too solid to add to my 55 kilos.” This in the same breath as “Hear good account of Derain show. Beaubourg proper mass meeting. While the Louvre totters for want of funds” (11 March 1977). Even more revealingly, he tries this on Myron, a kindred spirit: “Did you ever hate a conjunction? If so you’ll understand my feelings about “jusqu’à ce que” (16 June 1976).
