<h1>George Devine</h1>
<p>George Devine (1910-1966), a graduate of Oxford and President of the Oxford University Drama Society, invited John Gielgud to direct <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, in which he played Mercutio; he soon joined Gielgud’s company at the Queen’s Theatre, London. Mentored by Michel Saint-Denis (nephew of Jacques Copeau, who taught at the Vieux-Colombier school in Paris), Devine became involved with Saint-Denis’s London Theatre Studio, and immersed himself in administration and teaching. He served in India and Burma during the War, after which he rejoined Saint-Denis at the Old Vic and was made director of the Young Vic Company.</p>

<p>In 1956, Devine became Artistic Director of the English Stage Company, which he helped to establish at the Royal Court Theatre. From that platform, he applied his considerable energy to creating theatre with broadened artistic scope, wider popular audiences, and new playwrights: a theatre that responded to social and political change. He was an actor-manager immersed in the day-to-day practice of theatre, and committed to encouraging and supporting new writers.</p>  

<p>In 1957, Devine was instrumental in bringing the world premiere of Fin de partie and Acte sans paroles to London before directing the English translation of Endgame at the Royal Court in 1958, and playing the role of Hamm. Devine assisted SB in a protracted disputewith the Lord Chamberlain’s Office. SB gave Devine and the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre the first option on English productions of his plays, including <em>Happy Days</em> (1962), and <em>Play</em> (1964). The company also produced <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, directed by Anthony Page (1964). When asked, SB offered suggestions for other plays that might be staged by the Royal Court Theatre, notably works by Eugène Ionesco. Devine had announced his plans to leave the Royal Court Theatre in September 1965, when,  while acting in John Osborne’s <em>A Patriot for Me</em> in August, he suffered a heart attack, followed by a stroke.</p>

<p>SB was always grateful for Devine’s involvement in his work, calling him “the great inspirer.” It was due to Devine that the Royal Court Theatre had priority for SB’s plays in London. Although SB began to place his work with other theatres after Devine’s death, he remained close to Jocelyn Herbert (1917-2003), Devine’s companion, who designed many productions of SB’s work at the Royal Court and in other London venues.</p>
