<h2>Lawrence Harvey</h2>

<p>Lawrence Harvey (1925-1988) was Professor of French and Italian at Dartmouth College in the United States. Countless academics courted Beckett, and he virtually always received them politely, and agreed to answer, if he could, their questions (provided these did not bear on the details of his personal life). Not many got beyond this: Lawrence Harvey - “Larry” - was one of the few who did. The difficulty was usually the same: the academics wanted explanations, theories, an “inside story.” This was a currency in which Beckett simply did not deal. The result, inevitably, was frustration on both sides. Harvey had his own fundamental queries, but he sensed too something of the real nature of Beckett’s reluctance: that it was rooted, not in some dog-in-the-manger-ish wish to conceal secrets, but in a radically different conception of writing. In 1970, Harvey published <em>Samuel Beckett: Poet and Critic</em>: even though SB may have thought that too much was made both of the intricacies of his poetry and of the biographical details of his life, Harvey’s study remains one of the key works in the study of SB.</p>
