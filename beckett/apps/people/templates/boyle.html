<h1>Kay Boyle</h1>
<p>Kay Boyle (1902-1992), writer, teacher, and activist was born in St Paul, Minnesota, and educated in the United States, but from 1923 spent more than twenty years living and working in Europe, almost all of them in France. Her determination to be a writer encouraged her to join the expatriate, largely American literary community of Paris, where she met, among others, Eugene and Maria Jolas, Peggy Guggenheim, and Robert McAlmon, with whom she wrote <em>Being Geniuses Together</em>, a light-hearted, insider’s view of that world. Unlike many in it, such as Djuna Barnes or Nancy Cunard, she was a prolific writer: novels, short story collections, and books of verse (her <em>Collected Poems</em> was published in 1991), as well as essays and newspaper articles. She was on good terms with SB, though never as close to him as she might have liked. Both were contributors in the 1930s to <em>transition</em>, the ambitiously avant-garde review edited by the Jolases. As well as occasionally meeting, they corresponded on literary matters.</p>
<p>Boyle shared political views with Beckett, but the difference too began there: Boyle was above all an activist, something barely imaginable for Beckett. Largely on account of her political involvements she returned to the United States in the 1950’s, taking up a post in San Francisco State College, where she was a Professor of English from 1963 to 1979. A misunderstanding over a lecture (on a Joyce short story, “The Boarding House”) that she had sent to SB, had, when cleared up, the effect of closing the gap, as the increasing range and warmth of the letters between them clearly shows. Beckett was deeply impressed by the warmth and humanity of her politics – she was an early and voracious opponent of McCarthyism and of American policy in Vietnam – and by the more surprising fact that she never lost touch with the literary. The letters move in style from cautious and distance-preserving (“Dear Kay Boyle”) to affectionate and sympathetic, whether about her health or changes in her personal circumstances - changes that were often the consequence of her political activism. SB’s fondness increased with age, in spite of the huge differences between their lives. They finished on best of terms.</p>
